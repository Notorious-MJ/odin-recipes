      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Smash burgers are formed into balls of ground beef then pressed or
          smashed with a burger press into a thin patty as soon as they hit the
          grill. This creates extra browning and flavor on the outside while
          maintaining the pattyâ€™s juiciness.

      <p>
        We love burgers, from classic Juicy Burgers to Cheeseburger Sliders.
        Making your own patty from ground beef tastes so much better than
        flash-frozen or fast-food patties. These go down easier and you feel
        better after eating a fresh homemade burger because you control the
        quality of ingredients.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for pan)</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck (20% fat)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>4 potato rolls, toasted</li>
        <span><strong>For serving:</strong></span>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>mayonnaise</li>
        <li>shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
        <li>dill pickle slices</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Steps:</h5>
      <li>Heat a cast-iron griddle</li>
      <p>
        Heat a cast-iron griddle or large heavy skillet over medium-high until
        very hot, about 2 minutes, then lightly brush with vegetable oil. Divide
        ground beef into 4 equal portions (do not form patties).
      </p>
      <li>place portions on griddle and smash flat</li>
      <p>
        Working in batches if needed, place portions on griddle and smash flat
        with a spatula to form 4"-diameter patties (craggy edges are your
        friend). Season liberally with salt and cook, undisturbed, until outer
        edges are brown, about 2 minutes. Flip patties, season with salt, and
        place a slice of cheese on top of each patty. Cook until cheese droops
        and burgers are medium-rare, about 1 minute.
      </p>
      <li>Serve patties</li>
      <p>
        Serve patties on rolls with ketchup, mayonnaise, lettuce, and pickles.
